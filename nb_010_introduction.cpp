// %% [markdown]
// ## Grady Booch (OODA)
//
// - Clean Code is simple and direct.
// - Clean Code reads like well-written prose.
// - Clean code never obscures the designerâ€™s intent but rather is full of crisp abstractions and straightforward lines of control.
//

// ## Bjarne Stroustroup (C++)
//
// I like my code to be elegant and efficient.
//
// The logic should be straightforward to make it hard for bugs to hide, the dependencies minimal to ease maintenance, error handling complete according to an articulated strategy, and performance close to optimal so as not to tempt people to make the code messy with unprincipled optimizations. 
//
// Clean code does one thing well.

// %% [markdown]
// ### Elegant and Efficient
//
// - Straightforward logic
// - Minimal dependencies
// - Complete error handling
// - Performance close to optimal
// - Does one thing well

// ## Ward Cunningham (Wiki)
//
// You know you are reading clean code,  when every routine that you read is pretty much what you expected.
//
// You can call it beautiful code when the code also makes it look like the language was made for the problem.

// %% [markdown]
// ## Michael Feathers
//
// Clean code always looks like it was written by someone who cares.

// ## Summary: What is Clean Code?
// (According to important people...)
